### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 in general is one of my favorite labs because even though I'm already getting started on writing code, I find it enjoying when typing the basic code to compile and run the "Hello World!" program with just a single print statement.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, Part 1 in particular, is another of my favorites because I was able to learn about how double functions work, with how each conversions are initialized and declared in order for the conversion to work. 

* Lab 9

    Lab 9 Part 1 is also my favorite because this part references to what I learned also in calculus, which is arithmetic series, and I'm able to fill in some code and think about the current lessons in which my partner and I will fill in code, like the push.back function.
